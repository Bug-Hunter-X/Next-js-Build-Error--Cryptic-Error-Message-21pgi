```javascript
// pages/index.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my Next.js app</h1>
      <p>This is a simple example.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This solution is provided as a baseline.  The actual fix will depend on the nature of the original build error, which isn't specifically defined in the bug.  The `readme` file lists the steps needed to diagnose and resolve similar cryptic Next.js build problems.
