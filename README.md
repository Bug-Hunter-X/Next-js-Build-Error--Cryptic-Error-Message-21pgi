# Next.js Build Error: Cryptic Error Message

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js where a build error occurs with an unhelpful error message. The problem stems from a missing dependency or incorrect configuration, leading to a failure during the build process.

## Bug

The provided `pages/index.js` file seems innocuous, but depending on the project setup, it might cause a build error due to missing dependencies, incorrect import statements, or a configuration problem that is not clearly described in the Next.js error log.

## Solution

This issue can typically be resolved by:

1. **Checking your package.json:** Ensure all necessary packages are installed and the versions are compatible.
2. **Reviewing import statements:** Verify that all imported modules exist and are correctly referenced. Pay attention to casing and paths.
3. **Checking Next.js configuration:**  Make sure your `next.config.js` (if any) is correctly configured and doesn't cause conflicts.   
4. **Cleaning your cache:** Sometimes Next.js cache can create problems. Try running `next clean` before building again.
5. **Checking your build process:** Ensure your build environment is set up properly.

By carefully examining the project's dependencies, configuration, and build process, you can pinpoint the exact cause of the error and implement the necessary corrections.
